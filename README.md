### üí° The Challenge

Over 24 hours, your team will tackle one of several real-world quality control problems drawn from industrial engineering, healthcare systems, and energy systems.

- üß© 3 prompts released at kickoff ‚Äî each tied to a real dataset
- üß∞ Apply statistics and Six Sigma analytics to monitor and control system performance
- üß± Build something functional and demo-ready to solve a real-world problem - an R package, Python Library, REST API, or Dashboard!
- üîß Use metrics/techniques like the Mean Time to Failure (MTTF), System Reliability Modeling, Statistical Process Control, or others!
- üî¢ Evaluation Criteria: All projects will receive a score of 0 to 100 from the event staff. [Read more about the evaluation criteria here!](https://github.com/timothyfraser/sixsigmahackathon/blob/main/docs/criteria.md)
- üèÜ The Prize: Top team wins a prize and bragging rights.

### ‚ÅâÔ∏è Frequently Asked Questions 

- **Who can participate?** All Hackathon team members must be (1) on-campus, enrolled Cornell students and (2a) part of the Systems Engineering Masters of Engineering program OR (2b) enrolled in SYSEN 5300/MAE 5390.
*Eg. Anna is in SYSEN 5300 and Daphne is a SYSEN MEng student.*

- **Do I have to have Six Sigma Experience?** No! Many resources and trainings will be provided to you during the event, and many of the possible analyses you could do can be learned in a few minutes.

- **Do I have to be a coding wizard to participate?** No! As long as you have *some* prior coding experience in Python or R, you can use either programming language to code. A winning project does not necessarily require fabulous code, but rather a smart, intuitive design that solves a quality control problem! Plus, participating can be a fun way to gain coding experience.

- **What if I can't find team members?** Sign up anyways! If you don't have a team, we will match you with team members. A fun way to meet others in the systems engineering program!

- **Do I have to participate the whole 24 hours?** You do you. A successful team will work for most of the 24 hours.

- **Can I *ever* step out?** Yes, of course, but please keep it to a minimum.
*Eg. Anna steps out to get coffee, but Daphne stays until Anna gets back, etc.* OR *Eg. Daphne and Anna go to work at a coffeeshop/someone's apartment, then check in at the Hackathon again later.*

- **Can I ever sleep?** You do you. Historically, Hackathons are events that people stay awake for 24 hours, but your health is important. Consider, for example, staggering which team members take breaks when.

- **Can we relocate to a coffeeshop and work there instead?** Sure. You do you.

- **Can one of my team members not attend in person?** No. All team members must attend the Hackathon in-person to compete. i.e. A virtual participant in California is not allowed at this time.
*Eg. Anna, Daphne, Sam, and Bob all attend the Hackathon, in-person.*

- **What so I need to make in this Hackathon?** Your team will need to demo a working prototype coding solution at the end of the Hackathon.

- **Do I need a certain software for this Hackathon?** Yes, but you can pick from several! All team members need to install R or Python and at least 1 working coding interface software (eg. RStudio, VSCode, Cursor, Positron, etc.) BEFORE arriving at the Hackathon.

- **How should my team share our final product?** On a public GitHub repository! At least 1 team member must have a working GitHub ID, and that my team will publish our code to GitHub at the end of the event for review by our judges. 
*For example, Tim Fraser's GitHub ID is timothyfraser. Note: this is NOT a Cornell GitHub ID. Go get a normal GitHub account.*

- **What coding language should I use?** Plan to use R, Python, or some combination! Code must be fully reproducible and shared on GitHub.

- **What kind of skills would be helpful for my team?** Any of the following could be helpful, but depends on the kind of product your team chooses to make!
   - Building Functions in R/Python
   - Building a Package in R/Python
   - Using GitHub to Commit, Pull, and Push code
   - Statistical Analysis
   - Machine Learning
   - Reliability Analysis
   - Six Sigma Techniques
   - Querying an API
   - Building a small API
   - Building a ShinyApp dashboard 

- **How will our final products be evaluated?** Products will be evaluated based on a combination of (1) how well they fit and answer the prompt (to be released), (2) quality of concept, (3) completeness of implementation, and (4) level of polish. Further details to be released closer to date.

- More details coming soon!
