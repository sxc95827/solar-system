# üó®Ô∏è Prompts

[**The current document**](https://github.com/timothyfraser/sixsigmahackathon/blob/main/docs/prompts.md) will be updated at the start of the Hackathon event to contain 3-4 short prompts for the Hackathon.
teams will be asked to pick 1 prompt and design a tool around it. Please check back at the start of the hackathon for details!

### üí° The Challenge

Over 24 hours, your team will tackle one of several real-world quality control problems drawn from industrial engineering, healthcare systems, and energy systems.

- 3 prompts released at kickoff ‚Äî each tied to a real dataset
- Apply statistics and Six Sigma analytics to monitor and control system performance
- Build something functional and demo-ready

In this Hackathon, you will build a tool to implement quality control analytics to solve a real-world problem.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

1. üöÄ **Possible Outputs**: A publicly available tool, formatted as either:
   - An R package or Python library
   - A Public REST API
   - A Dashboard (eg. a ShinyApp)
2. üìà **2-3 Test Datasets** that can be used to demonstrate the tool‚Äôs effectiveness. These data sets do not need to be ‚Äòreal‚Äô data, but they should accurately represent what your data would look like when collected in real time. 
3. üìë **A codebook and README** for your datasets, describing what each file and variable means, and any other background information necessary for collecting this data.

### üó®Ô∏è Example Prompt

Prompts will be released at the start of the Hackathon on this page. 
See example prompt below. Notice how the question is solution-neutral; you could create many different tools to address this issue.

> - Design a system to monitor resource use (beds, staff hours) and detect when utilization exceeds safe thresholds. Provide synthetic hospital admission datasets.

### üí° Prompts 

Please pick from 1 of the following prompts below and create a tool to solve the problem discussed.

*It is not necessary to have prior knowledge of the system in your prompt. Use what you know already and what you can find out quickly to build out a sensible, useful tool.*

When building your tool, please refer to the [**üî¢ Evaluation Criteria**](https://github.com/timothyfraser/sixsigmahackathon )! For help, refer to üìö [**Resources for Building Your Tool**](https://github.com/timothyfraser/sixsigmahackathon/blob/main/docs/resources.md)
#### Prompt 1: Industrial Engineering

**Data centers** are key infrastructure in the AI economy, providing servers equipped with high numbers of GPUs needed for high speed model training and serving. Given the recent surge in GPU demand, data centers are struggling to keep up, and hardware failures need to be addressed swiftly. 
**Develop a quality control system to track quality and/or failure in GPU usage across data centers** for a system like Google Cloud or Amazon Web Services. 

#### Prompt 2: Energy Systems

**Utility scale solar power plants** are found all throughout New York state, due to significant promotion policies over the last decade. Utility scale solar can be made up of hundreds or even thousands of solar panels, each of which requires routine maintenance. Your team has been commissioned by the New York State Energy Research & Development Authority (NYSERDA), whose staff hope to better understand the lifespan remaining for existing utility-scale solar farms. 
**Design a quality control system to track and mitigate solar panel failure.**


#### Prompt 3: Health Systems

**Hospitals** require the coordination of many nurses and doctors on each floor for good communication and treatment of patients. However, in your hospital system, patients note wide and irregular gaps and how often nurses and doctors come to check on them during their inpatient care, impacting perceived and actual quality of treatment, and sometimes extending the stay of patients unnecessarily. Your hospital system has commissioned your team to **develop a quality control system for tracking and mitigating wait times for inpatient care while on the hospital floor.**

#### Prompt 4: Health Systems

**Nursing home patients** are prescribed a significant amount of medication due to health conditions exacerbated by age, and most nursing homes are well set up to automatically refill patients' prescriptions to ensure that they get their medication. However, patients may not always complete their prescriptions, due to new alternative medication being prescribed, temporary transfers throughout nursing homes and local hospital systems, and end-of-life care. This may lead to medication waste. **Design a quality control system to track and mitigate prescription medicine waste in nursing homes.**

### üí¨ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

- **I signed up for one topic in the Signup survey. Can I pick a different topic?** Yes.
- **How long do I have to pick a topic? You should pick your topic within the first 15 minutes of the Hackathon, and then stick to it.** You will need as much time as you can get to build your tool?
- **Where do I find tutorials on how to make a tool?** üìö [Resources for Building Your Tool](https://github.com/timothyfraser/sixsigmahackathon/blob/main/docs/resources.md)

### üîß Example Techniques

- Mean Time to Failure (MTTF)
- Probability of Failure
- System Reliability Modeling
- Statistical Process Control (SPC)
- Fault Tree Analysis

### üëç Advice

- This project is limited and short-term. Be sure to closely define the limits and scope of your product, so that you finish on time.
- A small product that works is better than a big complex product that doesn't.
- Your team has multiple members; delegate and specialize in different tasks!
